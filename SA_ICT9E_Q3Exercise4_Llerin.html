	<h3>Paris</h3>
	<img src="IMG_4168.jpg" height="50%" width="100%">
	<p> Paris is the capital of France and I visited this place back in 2019. For me, the most memorable and notable thing about Paris was how cold it was. When we left the airport, it was the very first time I can remember where my breath was visible. prior to my visit I did not understand why cartoon characters would wear scarves and earmuffs when it would snow, but when I continued to shiver I realized that they were called for. Seeing the Effiel tower was quite a shock and a strange experience since we constantly see it in media and now we are seeing the real thing. Another thing we noticed was how needlessly stylish and fasionable all the French People were. You could definitely tell who were tourists and who were actually French People.</p>
	<p> Things to do in France: Look at cool monuments, admire how cold it is compared to the Philippines, eat French Food.
